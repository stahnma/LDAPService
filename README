This is under development (I wish I could say heavy development, but I'd be lying)

I plan to try out Padrino with it. Who knows, maybe I'll make a mobile app/css for it too.


LDAPService
-------------
LDAP Self Service Manager or lssm as I am currently calling it, is a tool to allow for user
self-management and password recovery based a fairly typical LDAP setup.

The setup assumes you have users in an objectclass that contains 'userPassword' 
as the attribute that contains their password and that 'self-write' is enabled
on that attribute.  Most everything else is configurable in the configuration
file, which is simple YAML.

This project allows for:
* Self service of any self-writable attribute
* Password Recovery if a password is forgotten

Status
-------
Project is still pre-alpha.  It has some basic functionality, but bugs are 
probably quite common.  Also, the TODO list is growing quite long.

Setup
------
Right now this expects you check it out in /srv/lssm
Then run 'sudo rake httpd' on Fedora/RHEL/Centos
or 'sudo rake apache2' on Debian

* Install the proper Packages
* Ensure you can send email from the system
* Update your configuration file

Issue with TLS/SSL
* If you're using SSL on your directory and your system-wide ldap.conf is not world-readable
you can get odd errors that say 'unable to contact ldap server'.  If this happens, create a
.ldaprc in your web-server user's home directory.  See man ldap.conf(5).


Notes:
------
* The rakefile is a joke and only there for my test setup currently 
  (more or less)
